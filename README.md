# Johnson-Lindenstrauss-lemma
In mathematics, the Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss lemma is a result named after William B. Johnson and Joram Lindenstrauss concerning low-distortion embeddings of points from high-dimensional into low-dimensional Euclidean space. The lemma states that a set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are nearly preserved.

Here we are checking in this code, about how low the dimension value can be, without distorting the distances between datapoints too much.
